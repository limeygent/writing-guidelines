# YMYL Content Overlay (Tier 3)

**Load:** When content involves health, safety, financial, or legal topics
**Purpose:** Additional constraints that override Tier 1 defaults for sensitive content

---

## What is YMYL?

YMYL = "Your Money or Your Life"

Content that could impact a reader's:
- **Health** - Physical or mental wellbeing
- **Safety** - Personal or property safety
- **Finances** - Money, major purchases, investments
- **Legal** - Rights, obligations, legal consequences

HVAC content frequently triggers YMYL when discussing:
- Safety hazards (gas leaks, CO, electrical)
- Health impacts (air quality, mold, allergens)
- Major purchase decisions (system replacement)
- Cost estimates and financial decisions

---

## YMYL Trigger Topics

### Always YMYL
- Gas leak warnings or procedures
- Carbon monoxide safety
- Electrical hazards
- System replacement decisions ($5,000+)
- Health impacts of HVAC issues
- Warranty and legal implications

### Sometimes YMYL
- Cost estimates (depends on context)
- DIY repairs (if safety-adjacent)
- Refrigerant handling (regulated substance)
- Indoor air quality claims

### Rarely YMYL
- Basic maintenance tips
- Filter replacement
- Thermostat settings
- General efficiency information

---

## YMYL Constraints (Override Tier 1)

### Language Requirements

**Use qualified language:**
- "may" instead of "will"
- "can help" instead of "fixes"
- "typically" instead of "always"
- "in many cases" instead of "definitely"

**Avoid absolute claims:**
- ❌ "This will fix your problem"
- ✓ "This often resolves the issue"
- ❌ "Your furnace is dangerous"
- ✓ "These symptoms may indicate a safety concern"

### Cost Content

**NEVER include specific cost estimates in YMYL content.**

Instead:
- Recommend getting professional quotes
- Mention factors that affect cost
- Direct to consultation for pricing

**Why:** Costs vary significantly by location, equipment, and situation. Incorrect estimates could lead to poor financial decisions.

**Wrong:**
> Replacing your furnace costs $3,000-5,000.

**Right:**
> Furnace replacement costs vary based on equipment type, efficiency rating, and installation complexity. Request quotes from licensed contractors for accurate pricing.

### Safety Content

**Always recommend professional consultation for:**
- Gas-related issues
- Electrical concerns
- Unusual odors or sounds
- System failures during extreme weather
- Any symptom that could indicate CO risk

**Include safety disclaimers once (not repeatedly):**
> ⚠️ If you smell gas or suspect carbon monoxide, leave immediately and call your gas company or 911.

**Position safety info:**
- Critical warnings: Before any DIY instructions
- General cautions: In dedicated "Safety" section
- Not scattered throughout (creates alarm fatigue)

### Health Claims

**Avoid unsubstantiated health claims:**
- ❌ "Poor air quality causes asthma"
- ✓ "Poor air quality may aggravate respiratory conditions"
- ❌ "This filter removes 99% of allergens"
- ✓ "HEPA filters are designed to capture airborne particles"

**Cite sources when making health-related statements:**
- EPA guidelines
- ASHRAE standards
- Manufacturer specifications

### Credentials Over Claims

**Emphasize qualifications:**
- Licensed contractors
- EPA certifications
- Manufacturer training
- Years of experience (specific, not vague)

**Avoid superiority claims:**
- ❌ "We're the best HVAC company"
- ✓ "Our technicians hold EPA 608 certification"
- ❌ "Fastest service in the area"
- ✓ "Same-day service available for emergencies"

## Topic Sentence Formula (YMYL)

For YMYL topics, use this softened structure:

**Standard:** "[Solution] fixes [problem]."
**YMYL:** "[Provider/solution] is a [solution type] that can help address [general concern]."

**Examples:**

Standard (non-YMYL):
> Regular filter changes keep your system running efficiently.

YMYL (health-adjacent):
> Regular filter replacement is a maintenance practice that can help maintain indoor air quality.

Standard (non-YMYL):
> Replace your furnace if it's over 15 years old.

YMYL (financial):
> A furnace over 15 years old may be approaching the end of its reliable service life. A professional assessment can help determine whether repair or replacement makes more sense for your situation.

---

## What YMYL Does NOT Mean

YMYL doesn't mean:
- Being vague to the point of uselessness
- Refusing to provide helpful information
- Adding disclaimers to every sentence
- Avoiding the topic entirely

**Balance helpfulness with responsibility:**
- Provide genuinely useful information
- Acknowledge limitations and variables
- Direct to professionals for personalized advice
- Be accurate about what you can and can't know

---

## Examples

### Good: Safety Warning (Once, Prominent)

> **⚠️ Safety First**
>
> If you smell gas or your CO detector is alarming, leave your home immediately and call your gas company or 911 from outside. Do not attempt any troubleshooting.
>
> For non-emergency furnace issues, the steps below can help identify common problems.

**Why it works:** Clear, actionable, positioned before DIY content, not repeated.

---

### Bad: Safety Warning (Scattered, Repetitive)

> Check your thermostat settings. **Remember, if you smell gas, leave immediately.**
>
> Next, inspect your filter. **Safety note: Gas leaks are dangerous. If you smell gas, evacuate.**
>
> Look at the pilot light. **Warning: Never attempt repairs if you smell gas.**

**Why it fails:** Same warning 3 times creates alarm fatigue, buries useful content.

---

### Good: Cost Discussion (YMYL-Compliant)

> **What Affects Repair Costs**
>
> Furnace repair costs depend on:
> - Type of component that failed
> - Age and model of your system
> - Whether parts are readily available
> - Labor rates in your area
>
> For an accurate estimate, request a diagnostic visit. Most companies charge $75-150 for diagnosis, often waived if you proceed with repair.

**Why it works:** Explains factors without giving false precision. Provides actionable next step.

---

### Bad: Cost Discussion (Overconfident)

> A flame sensor replacement costs $150-250. Ignitor replacement runs $200-400. If your control board is bad, expect to pay $500-800 for the repair.

**Why it fails:** Presents ranges as fact when actual costs vary widely. Reader may make decisions based on inaccurate expectations.

---

### Good: Health-Related Content

> **Indoor Air Quality and Your HVAC System**
>
> Your HVAC system plays a role in indoor air quality by filtering airborne particles and controlling humidity. According to EPA guidelines, maintaining your system—including regular filter changes—is one factor in managing indoor air quality.
>
> For specific concerns about air quality or respiratory health, consult with a healthcare provider or indoor air quality specialist.

**Why it works:** Qualified language, cites authority, directs to appropriate professionals.

---

### Bad: Health-Related Content

> Poor air quality from a dirty HVAC system causes allergies, asthma attacks, and respiratory infections. Changing your filter prevents these health problems and keeps your family safe from airborne diseases.

**Why it fails:** Overstates causal relationships. Makes health promises the writer can't verify.
