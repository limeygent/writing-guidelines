# Blog Content Style Guide
## Universal Standards for Readable, Conversational, Scannable Content

---

## 1. Punctuation Standards

### 1.1 Em-Dash Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**NEVER use em-dashes (—) anywhere in blog content.** Em-dashes create formal, academic tone and interrupt reading flow.

**Replace em-dashes with:**

**Parentheses** for parenthetical information:
```
❌ Wrong: "The heater—which costs $3,500-6,500—requires professional installation"
✅ Right: "The heater (costing $3,500-6,500) requires professional installation"
```

**Commas** for lists or clarification:
```
❌ Wrong: "When any part fails—igniter, flame sensor, pressure switch, or control board—the system shuts down"
✅ Right: "When any part fails, including igniter, flame sensor, or control board, the system shuts down"
```

**New sentences** for separate thoughts:
```
❌ Wrong: "DFW's 300 ppm calcium water—compared to the national average of 80-150 ppm—requires proactive descaling"
✅ Right: "DFW's 300 ppm calcium water requires proactive descaling. The national average is only 80-150 ppm."
✅ Right: "North Texas water has 300 ppm calcium hardness, which is double the national average of 80-150 ppm."
```

**Colons** for introducing lists:
```
❌ Wrong: "Common failures include—igniter burnout, flame sensor corrosion, and exchanger scaling"
✅ Right: "Common failures include: igniter burnout, flame sensor corrosion, and exchanger scaling"
✅ Right: "Common failures include igniter burnout, flame sensor corrosion, and exchanger scaling"
```

**Semicolons** for related independent clauses:
```
❌ Wrong: "The system requires several components working together—when any single part fails, everything stops"
✅ Right: "The system requires several components working together; when any single part fails, everything stops"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Em-dashes interrupt reading flow and feel jarring
- They create an academic, formal tone
- Parentheses and commas are more familiar to general readers
- Shorter, simpler sentences improve scannability
- Em-dashes are harder to read on mobile devices

---

### 1.2 Oxford Comma (REQUIRED)

**Always use Oxford commas (serial commas) in lists of three or more items.**

The Oxford comma is the comma before "and" or "or" in a list.

**Examples:**
```
❌ Wrong: "Test the igniter, flame sensor and control board"
✅ Right: "Test the igniter, flame sensor, and control board"

❌ Wrong: "Available for Pentair, Hayward and Raypak heaters"
✅ Right: "Available for Pentair, Hayward, and Raypak heaters"

❌ Wrong: "Costs depend on size, condition and location"
✅ Right: "Costs depend on size, condition, and location"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Eliminates ambiguity in lists
- Standard in American English (our default)
- Improves clarity for scanners
- Professional standard for web content

---

### 1.3 Quotation Marks

**Use US style by default** (periods and commas inside quotation marks):
```
US Style: The technician said, "Your heater needs descaling."
UK Style: The technician said, 'Your heater needs descaling'.
```

**Localization:** If company profile specifies UK/AUS location, use UK style with single quotes and punctuation outside.

---

### 1.4 Other Punctuation Rules

**Ellipsis (...):**
- Use sparingly, only for dramatic pause or trailing thought
- Avoid in professional service content
- Better: Use complete sentences

**Hyphens vs En-dashes:**
- **Hyphens (-)** for compound modifiers: "3-year warranty," "factory-trained technicians"
- **En-dashes (–)** for ranges only in rare formal contexts (generally just use hyphen: "150-200")
- **Em-dashes (—)** NEVER USE

**Apostrophes:**
- Possessives: "heater's exchanger," "Pentair's warranty"
- Contractions: "it's" (it is), "you'll" (you will), "we've" (we have)
- Decades: 2020s (no apostrophe), not 2020's

---

## 2. Voice & Tone Standards

### 2.1 Use Contractions (REQUIRED)

**Always use contractions to create conversational, friendly tone.**

Contractions make content feel less formal and more approachable for homeowners and general readers.

**Common Contractions to Use:**
```
✅ Use: it's, you'll, we've, don't, can't, won't, shouldn't, hasn't, haven't
❌ Avoid: it is, you will, we have, do not, cannot, will not, should not, has not, have not
```

**Examples:**
```
❌ Formal: "You will need to descale your heater every 2-3 years if you do not want efficiency loss"
✅ Conversational: "You'll need to descale your heater every 2-3 years if you don't want efficiency loss"

❌ Formal: "It is important to test the igniter annually because it will fail without warning"
✅ Conversational: "It's important to test the igniter annually because it'll fail without warning"

❌ Formal: "We have maintained North Texas pool heaters since 2013"
✅ Conversational: "We've maintained North Texas pool heaters since 2013"
```

**Exceptions:**
- YMYL content where professional tone requires formal language
- Legal disclaimers or warranty language
- When emphasis requires full form: "Do NOT attempt this yourself" (not "Don't")

---

### 2.2 Direct Address

**Use "you" and "your" to speak directly to the reader:**
```
✅ Right: "Your pool heater faces unique challenges in DFW's hard water"
❌ Wrong: "Pool heaters face unique challenges in DFW's hard water"

✅ Right: "You'll save $500-1,500 by preventing emergency repairs"
❌ Wrong: "Homeowners save $500-1,500 by preventing emergency repairs"
```

---

### 2.3 Active Voice (80%+ of Sentences)

Prefer active voice for clarity and directness:
```
✅ Active: "Technicians test igniter resistance using a multimeter"
❌ Passive: "Igniter resistance is tested using a multimeter by technicians"

✅ Active: "Annual maintenance prevents 80% of common failures"
❌ Passive: "80% of common failures are prevented by annual maintenance"
```

**Acceptable Passive Use:**
- When actor is unknown or unimportant
- In YMYL content for professional tone
- When emphasis is on the action, not the actor

---

## 3. Numbers & Measurements

### 3.1 Use Numerals for Scannability (CRITICAL)

**Always use numerals (1, 2, 3...) instead of spelling out numbers.**

Numerals are faster to scan and stand out visually, which is critical for web content where users scan rather than read word-for-word.

**Examples:**
```
❌ Wrong: "Replace the igniter every three to four years"
✅ Right: "Replace the igniter every 3-4 years"

❌ Wrong: "Annual maintenance costs one hundred fifty to three hundred dollars"
✅ Right: "Annual maintenance costs $150-300"

❌ Wrong: "Test pressure at fifteen to twenty-five psi"
✅ Right: "Test pressure at 15-25 psi"

❌ Wrong: "Descaling takes two to three hours"
✅ Right: "Descaling takes 2-3 hours"
```

**Exception - Starting Sentences:**
When a number starts a sentence, spell it out OR restructure:
```
❌ Wrong: "3 components require annual testing"
✅ Right: "Three components require annual testing"
✅ Better: "You'll need to test 3 components annually" (restructure to avoid starting with number)
```

**Exception - Very Large Round Numbers:**
For readability in very large numbers, combine numerals with words:
```
✅ Right: "Over 500 installations since 2013"
✅ Right: "More than $1 million in coverage"
```

---

### 3.2 Ranges

**Use hyphens for ranges** (not "to" or "through"):
```
✅ Right: "3-4 years," "150-200," "$3-8 per square foot," "15-25 psi"
❌ Wrong: "3 to 4 years," "150 through 200," "$3 to $8 per square foot"
```

**Exception:** In sentences where clarity requires "to":
```
✅ Acceptable: "The lifespan ranges from 10 to 15 years depending on maintenance"
```

---

### 3.3 Percentages

**Use numerals + percent symbol:**
```
✅ Right: "80% of failures," "Efficiency drops to 50-60%"
❌ Wrong: "Eighty percent," "50 to 60 percent"
```

---

### 3.4 Temperature

**Use numerals + degree symbol + unit:**
```
✅ Right: "100°F," "38°F," "102-104°F"
❌ Wrong: "100 degrees Fahrenheit," "one hundred degrees"
```

**Localization:**
- US: Fahrenheit (°F)
- UK/AUS: Celsius (°C) - convert all temperatures

---

### 3.5 Currency

**Use dollar sign + numerals:**
```
✅ Right: "$150-300," "$3,500-6,500," "$1M+"
❌ Wrong: "150 to 300 dollars," "three thousand five hundred dollars"
```

**Ranges:** Include dollar sign only once at start:
```
✅ Right: "$150-300"
❌ Wrong: "$150-$300"
```

---

### 3.6 Measurements

**Use numerals + abbreviated units:**
```
✅ Right: "15-25 psi," "300 ppm," "40-50 GPM," "2" unions"
❌ Wrong: "fifteen to twenty-five psi," "three hundred parts per million"
```

**Common Abbreviations:**
- psi (pounds per square inch)
- GPM (gallons per minute)
- ppm (parts per million)
- sq ft (square feet)
- BTU (British Thermal Units)

---

## 4. Capitalization

### 4.1 Brand Names

**Follow manufacturer's official capitalization:**
```
✅ Right: Pentair, Hayward, Raypak, Jandy, Sta-Rite, Polaris
❌ Wrong: pentair, HAYWARD, raypak
```

### 4.2 Product Names

**Follow manufacturer's product capitalization:**
```
✅ Right: MasterTemp, H-Series, IntelliTouch, AquaLink, Max-E-Therm
❌ Wrong: Mastertemp, h-series, Intellitouch
```

### 4.3 Headings

**Use sentence case for H2 and H3 headings** (capitalize only first word and proper nouns):
```
✅ Right: "Annual professional service checklist"
✅ Right: "Why annual maintenance matters for DFW pool heaters"
❌ Wrong: "Annual Professional Service Checklist"
❌ Wrong: "Why Annual Maintenance Matters For DFW Pool Heaters"
```

**Exception:** POST_TITLE (H1) can use title case if natural:
```
✅ Acceptable: "Pool Heater Annual Maintenance Checklist for North Texas Hard Water"
```

### 4.4 Certifications & Licenses

**Capitalize official certifications and licenses:**
```
✅ Right: CPO-certified, IPSSA-certified, RAIL-licensed, A+ BBB rating
❌ Wrong: cpo-certified, Ipssa-Certified, rail-licensed
```

---

## 5. Localization Standards

### 5.1 Detecting Region

**Check company profile for location/region specification:**
- If `location` field contains UK, United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Wales → Use UK English
- If `location` field contains Australia, AUS, AU → Use Australian English (similar to UK)
- Default or US location → Use US English

### 5.2 UK/Australian English

**Spelling Differences:**
```
US → UK/AUS
color → colour
organize → organise
license → licence
center → centre
fiber → fibre
gray → grey
neighbor → neighbour
vapor → vapour
```

**Vocabulary Differences:**
```
US → UK/AUS
faucet → tap
trunk (car) → boot
elevator → lift
apartment → flat
sidewalk → pavement
yard → garden
garbage/trash → rubbish
```

**Date Format:**
```
US: MM/DD/YYYY (10/30/2025)
UK/AUS: DD/MM/YYYY (30/10/2025)
```

**Quotation Marks:**
```
US: Double quotes with punctuation inside
UK/AUS: Single quotes with punctuation outside
```

**Measurements:**
```
US: Imperial (°F, psi, gallons, feet)
UK/AUS: Metric (°C, bar/kPa, litres, metres) - may need conversion
```

### 5.3 Implementation

When writing content for UK/AUS clients:
1. Convert all spelling to UK/AUS standards
2. Use UK/AUS vocabulary where applicable
3. Convert temperatures to Celsius
4. Use metric measurements (or provide both systems)
5. Format dates as DD/MM/YYYY
6. Use single quotation marks

---

## 9. H1/Title Standards

**Keep H1s short and keyword-focused.** Match common search queries.

```
✅ Right: "Furnace Blowing Cold Air"
✅ Right: "Heat Pump Frozen or Iced Up"
✅ Right: "Some Rooms Colder Than Others"
❌ Wrong: "Why Is My Furnace Blowing Cold Air? A Complete Troubleshooting Guide"
❌ Wrong: "Everything You Need to Know About Heat Pump Ice"
❌ Wrong: "Here's What to Do When Your Furnace Won't Start"
```

**Avoid filler phrases:**
- "Complete guide"
- "What you need to know"
- "Everything about"
- "Here's what to do"
- "A comprehensive look at"

**No punctuation in H1s.** If you need a colon, question mark, or parentheses, the title is too long. Restructure it.

```
❌ Wrong: "Furnace Won't Start: Quick Troubleshooting Guide for Homeowners"
✅ Right: "Furnace Won't Start or Turn On"

❌ Wrong: "Why your furnace keeps turning on and off (and how to fix it)"
✅ Right: "Furnace Keeps Turning On and Off"
```

---

## 10. Opening Paragraph Standards

**Answer the search query in the first sentence.** State causes, facts, or the key distinction the reader needs. Do not lead with the business name.

```
✅ Right: "A furnace blowing cold air is usually caused by a thermostat set to 'fan on,' a dirty air filter, or an ignition problem."
✅ Right: "Heat pump supply air runs 85-95°F, which feels cooler than furnace air at 120-140°F. This is normal, not a malfunction."
✅ Right: "Some frost on your heat pump is normal in cold weather. A solid block of ice covering the unit is not."

❌ Wrong: "Trusted Heating & Air Conditioning provides expert furnace diagnostics and repair for McKinney homeowners."
❌ Wrong: "At Trusted Heating & Air Conditioning, we help homeowners solve heating problems."
```

**Business name woven in naturally, not leading:**

```
✅ Right: "This guide from Trusted Heating & Air Conditioning in McKinney covers the most common causes..."
✅ Right: "...This guide from [Business Name] in [City] explains..."

❌ Wrong: "Trusted Heating & Air Conditioning helps McKinney homeowners diagnose..."
❌ Wrong: "[Business Name] is here to help you with..."
```

**Opening paragraph formula:**
1. First sentence: Answer the query (causes, facts, key distinction)
2. Second sentence: Business name + location + what the guide covers
3. Include: DIY vs professional, what causes the issue, when to call for service

**Example of correct structure:**
```
Short cycling means your furnace runs for a few minutes, shuts off, then restarts repeatedly. Common causes include a clogged filter, blocked vents, or an oversized unit. This guide from Trusted Heating & Air Conditioning in McKinney explains how to confirm short cycling, what's causing it, and whether it's a DIY fix or needs professional repair.
```

---

## 11. Tone: Objective Over Conversational

**Be direct and factual.** Avoid empathy fluff that adds words without value. Readers want answers, not validation.

**Phrases to avoid:**
```
❌ "You're not alone"
❌ "We understand how frustrating this can be"
❌ "Don't worry"
❌ "Take a deep breath"
❌ "Sound familiar?"
❌ "We've all been there"
❌ "The good news is..."
❌ "Here's the thing..."
❌ "Let's dive in"
```

**Use instead:**
```
✅ Direct statements of fact
✅ Specific causes and percentages
✅ Clear DIY vs professional guidance
✅ Concrete numbers and timeframes
```

**Examples:**

```
❌ Wrong: "There's nothing more frustrating than a furnace that won't start. Don't worry, you're not alone, and we're here to help."

✅ Right: "A furnace that won't start is often caused by a tripped breaker, dead thermostat batteries, or a switched-off power switch. About 40% of no-start calls have a DIY fix."
```

```
❌ Wrong: "We understand how stressful it can be when some rooms are cold while others are warm. Sound familiar? Let's dive into what might be causing this."

✅ Right: "Uneven heating is usually caused by closed vents, blocked registers, or duct problems. About 60-70% of cases have a DIY fix."
```

**Why this matters:**
- Readers scanning for answers don't need emotional validation
- Fluff phrases are SEO-neutral at best, often signal low-quality content
- Direct answers build trust faster than empathy statements
- Objective tone positions the business as knowledgeable, not salesy
