# Substance-First Writing Standards

Standards for creating specific, verifiable, customer-focused content that passes the "So What?" and "As Opposed to What?" tests. These guidelines eliminate vague claims, buzzwords, and meaningless statements that dilute your authority and waste the reader's attention.

**Key principle:** Every sentence must answer "Why should the reader care?" and "How is this different from alternatives?" Generic claims that any competitor could make have no place in quality content.

---

## When to Use This Guide

**Use substance-first.md for:**
- ✓ All body content across all article types
- ✓ Service descriptions and value propositions
- ✓ Company background and experience statements
- ✓ Case studies and testimonials
- ✓ Product/service comparisons
- ✓ Any claim about your business, service, or results

**Apply alongside:**
- paragraphs.md (for structure and length)
- faq.md (for answer specificity)
- tables.md (for data presentation)
- ymyl.md (for medical/financial claims)

**Note:** Substance-first principles apply universally. This guide layers content quality requirements on top of structural guidelines.

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Golden Rule

**If a competitor could copy-paste your claim and it would be equally true for them, delete it.**

This single test eliminates 80% of weak content. "We provide quality service" could be written by anyone. "We complete residential HVAC installations in 6-8 hours with same-day service available in Collin County" is defensible and specific.

### The Three Mandatory Tests

Every sentence must pass all three tests before publication:

**1. The "So What?" Test**
- Why should the reader care about this claim?
- What changes for the customer because of this?
- What problem does this solve or benefit does this create?

**2. The "As Opposed to What?" Test**
- How is this different from alternatives?
- What would happen with a competitor or without this service?
- What's the baseline you're being compared against?

**3. The Specificity Test**
- Could this be more concrete with numbers, names, or details?
- Is there a vague word that could become specific?
- Can a reader verify this claim?

### Writing Philosophy Shift

**From company-focused to customer-focused:**
- Not what you do, but what the customer gets
- Not your features, but their outcomes
- Not your effort, but their results

**From abstract to concrete:**
- Not "quality," but specific materials and methods
- Not "experience," but lessons learned that benefit customers
- Not "better," but quantified improvements with baselines

---

## Mandatory Deletions

These phrases fail the Golden Rule test. Delete on sight and replace with substance.

### Tier 1: Critical BS (Delete Immediately)

**Meaningless descriptors:**
- industry-leading, best-in-class, world-class
- cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, next-generation
- premier, elite, top-tier
- revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive

**Generic commitment statements:**
- committed to excellence, passionate about, dedicated to
- we pride ourselves, we believe, we strive
- our mission is, focused on
- customer satisfaction is our priority

**Vague solutions:**
- innovative solutions, robust platform, seamless integration
- turnkey solution, full-service, one-stop-shop
- comprehensive approach, holistic solution
- end-to-end service

**Why these fail:** Any business can claim these. They provide zero information and waste the reader's attention. Replace with specific differentiators.

### Tier 2: Empty Comparisons (Require Specific Baseline)

Never use comparison words without stating the comparison:

**Incomplete comparisons:**
- better, faster, cheaper, more reliable
- higher quality, improved, enhanced, optimized
- superior, advanced, more efficient
- increased, reduced (without specifying by how much)

**Fix:** Add specific comparison with numbers.

❌ **Delete:** "We provide faster service"
✓ **Replace:** "We respond within 2 hours vs. the industry average of 24-48 hours"

❌ **Delete:** "More affordable pricing"
✓ **Replace:** "$2,400 average project cost vs. $3,200 regional average (HomeAdvisor 2024)"

### Tier 3: Obvious Statements (Fail the Reversal Test)

If the opposite would be absurd, the statement is worthless:

**Examples that fail:**
- customer-focused (vs. customer-ignoring?)
- quality-driven (vs. mediocrity-driven?)
- detail-oriented (vs. detail-oblivious?)
- professional service (vs. unprofessional service?)
- results-oriented (vs. failure-oriented?)

**The reversal test:** Would any company claim the opposite? If not, delete it.

### Tier 4: Weasel Words (Replace With Specifics)

Vague quantifiers that avoid commitment:

**Vague quantities:**
- many, various, numerous, several
- some, most, often, typically, generally
- approximately, around, about (when exact numbers exist)

**Hedging words:**
- can, may, might, could, possibly, potentially
- helps, improves, enhances (without specifying how much)

**Fix:** Replace with specific numbers or delete.

❌ **Weak:** "We've completed many projects"
✓ **Strong:** "We've completed 847 projects since 2018"

❌ **Weak:** "This helps reduce costs"
✓ **Strong:** "This reduces monthly utility costs by 22-28% based on our client data (n=320)"

---

## The Specificity Ladder

Every claim should climb as high as possible on the specificity ladder. Higher = better.

### Level 1: Worthless (Delete)
Generic adjectives without substance:
- "Quality service"
- "Professional team"
- "Excellent results"

### Level 2: Weak (Needs Improvement)
Vague descriptors without measurement:
- "Fast service"
- "Experienced team"
- "Affordable pricing"

### Level 3: Better (Acceptable Baseline)
Includes one specific element:
- "24-hour service"
- "15 years in business"
- "$2,000 average project"

### Level 4: Good (Target Standard)
Includes specific number plus context:
- "24-hour guaranteed response in Collin County"
- "15 years specializing in commercial refrigeration with 2,000+ installations"
- "$2,000 average project with itemized quotes within 24 hours"

### Level 5: Excellent (Optimal)
Includes specific number, comparison, verification, and customer benefit:
- "24-hour guaranteed response in Collin County (or service is free) vs. industry average of 3-5 days, with GPS tracking so you know when we're arriving"
- "15 years specializing in commercial refrigeration with 2,000+ installations across DFW—experience that means we've diagnosed 98% of walk-in cooler failures within 15 minutes"
- "$2,000 average project with itemized quotes within 24 hours, typically 18% below competitor quotes per HomeAdvisor data"

**Goal:** Most content at Level 4, ambitious content at Level 5.

---

## Replacement Patterns

Use these proven patterns to transform weak claims into substantive content.

### Pattern 1: Time Periods → Learned Benefits

Time in business means nothing unless it translates to customer benefit.

**Formula:**
```
Since [YEAR], we've [SPECIFIC WORK] and learned that [INSIGHT THAT HELPS CUSTOMER]
```

❌ **Weak:** "25 years of experience"

✓ **Strong:** "Since 1999, we've completed 2,400+ residential HVAC installations across North Texas and learned that 73% of premature system failures come from three installation mistakes—undersized return air, improper refrigerant charge, and failed condensate drainage—which we've eliminated from our process"

❌ **Weak:** "Decades of expertise"

✓ **Strong:** "Since 2008, we've maintained 847 pool heaters in Collin County and discovered that DFW's 300-400 ppm calcium levels cause scale buildup 2.4x faster than national averages—which is why we mandate bi-annual descaling instead of the industry-standard annual service"

**Why it works:**
- Specific start year (verifiable)
- Quantified work (2,400 installations, 847 heaters)
- Specific insight that benefits customer
- Shows expertise through learned patterns

### Pattern 2: Buzzwords → Specific Features + Benefits

Replace every buzzword with concrete features and customer outcomes.

**Formula:**
```
[SPECIFIC FEATURE/METHOD] that [CUSTOMER BENEFIT WITH MEASUREMENT]
```

❌ **Weak:** "innovative platform with seamless integration"

✓ **Strong:** "connects to your existing ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics) in under 2 hours with zero downtime, so your team continues working while we configure the system"

❌ **Weak:** "cutting-edge technology"

✓ **Strong:** "thermal imaging cameras that detect heat loss patterns invisible to the naked eye, identifying problem areas that waste $40-80 monthly on your energy bills"

❌ **Weak:** "robust security features"

✓ **Strong:** "256-bit AES encryption (same standard used by banks) combined with biometric authentication, preventing the data breaches that cost businesses an average of $4.35M per incident (IBM 2024)"

**Why it works:**
- Specific technology/method named
- Clear customer benefit
- Quantified outcome or comparison
- Sometimes includes verification source

### Pattern 3: Empty Comparisons → Quantified Baselines

Never claim "better" without proving it.

**Formula:**
```
[SPECIFIC METRIC] vs. [COMPARISON BASELINE] ([SOURCE IF AVAILABLE])
```

❌ **Weak:** "faster turnaround time"

✓ **Strong:** "8-week project completion vs. the 18-24 week industry average (National Association of Home Builders 2024)"

❌ **Weak:** "more reliable service"

✓ **Strong:** "99.7% uptime in 2024 vs. the industry standard of 95-98% (verified by our third-party monitoring service, StatusPage)"

❌ **Weak:** "better results"

✓ **Strong:** "67% average close rate vs. the CRM industry benchmark of 27% (Salesforce State of Sales 2024)"

**Why it works:**
- Specific number, not vague "more/better"
- Stated comparison point (what are you beating?)
- Source when possible (builds credibility)
- Measurable and verifiable

### Pattern 4: Vague Claims → Named Proof

Replace assertions with evidence.

**Formula:**
```
[SPECIFIC CUSTOMER/COMPANY] [SPECIFIC RESULT] in [TIMEFRAME] by [METHOD]
```

❌ **Weak:** "We help businesses reduce costs"

✓ **Strong:** "Johnson Manufacturing reduced operational costs by 35% ($127,000) in Q1 2024 by eliminating overstock through our real-time inventory system"

❌ **Weak:** "Our clients see great results"

✓ **Strong:** "The Hendersons (Frisco) avoided a $2,100 heat exchanger replacement by catching scale buildup during our April 2024 thermal inspection—extending their heater life by an estimated 5 years"

**For anonymous testimonials (less credible but acceptable):**

✓ **Acceptable:** "A Plano restaurant owner cut food waste costs from $3,200 to $890 monthly (72% reduction) using our inventory tracking system over 6 months"

**Why it works:**
- Real names build trust (even first name + city)
- Specific dollar amounts or percentages
- Specific timeframe
- Explains the method/cause

### Pattern 5: Features → Customer Outcomes

Translate what you do into what customers get.

**Formula:**
```
[FEATURE] so that [CUSTOMER OUTCOME/BENEFIT]
```

❌ **Weak:** "We use commercial-grade materials"

✓ **Strong:** "We use 100% solids epoxy (zero VOCs) so your garage is usable within 24 hours instead of the 3-5 days required for water-based coatings, and you get 15-20 year durability instead of the 5-7 years typical for garage floor paint"

❌ **Weak:** "We have a comprehensive inspection process"

✓ **Strong:** "We perform 47-point inspections (following NACHI standards) so you know exactly what needs immediate repair ($500-2,000 range), what can wait 2-3 years, and what's normal wear—preventing the $8,000-15,000 surprise bills that come from deferred maintenance"

**Why it works:**
- Names the feature specifically
- Explains the customer benefit clearly
- Often includes comparison or timeframe
- Answers "so what?" directly

---

## Proof Hierarchy

Rank your claims by proof strength. Use the highest tier available.

### Tier 1: Strongest Proof (Use Whenever Possible)

**Verifiable third-party data:**
- Industry benchmark reports with source citations
- Third-party certifications with verification numbers
- Government data or licensed research
- Published case studies with full company names

**Example:** "Our average project cost is $2,400 vs. the regional average of $3,200 (HomeAdvisor 2024 Dallas-Fort Worth Cost Guide, page 47)"

### Tier 2: Strong Proof (Good Standard)

**Named customer testimonials:**
- Full company name with specific results
- First name + city + specific outcomes
- Aggregate data from your customer base

**Example:** "Johnson Manufacturing (McKinney) reduced inventory costs by $127,000 in Q1 2024 using our system"

**Example:** "Average client saves $43,000 in year one (based on 2024 client survey, n=320 respondents)"

### Tier 3: Moderate Proof (Use Sparingly)

**Quantified internal data:**
- "We've completed 847 installations since 2018"
- "92% of our clients exceed their original warranty period"

**Named awards with verification:**
- "2024 Angi Super Service Award (verification #HL-1234567)"

### Tier 4: Weak Proof (Avoid When Possible)

**Anonymous testimonials:**
- "A local restaurant owner saved $2,400 monthly"
- "One client reported 40% cost reduction"

**Self-reported stats without verification:**
- "Most customers are satisfied"
- "High success rate"

### Tier 5: No Proof (Never Use)

**Unsubstantiated claims:**
- Generic statements without support
- Buzzwords and jargon
- Claims everyone makes
- Unquantified or unverifiable assertions

---

## Red Flags: Stop and Revise

If you see these patterns in your draft, stop immediately and revise.

### Red Flag 1: Three Adjectives Without a Noun

❌ "We provide exceptional, professional, quality service"

This is filler. Replace with one specific noun:

✓ "We respond within 2 hours with GPS-tracked service vehicles"

### Red Flag 2: "We Are" Statements Without Proof

❌ "We are committed to excellence"
❌ "We are industry leaders"
❌ "We are focused on quality"

These are claims without evidence. Replace with proof:

✓ "We've maintained an average 4.9/5 rating across 840 reviews since 2018"

### Red Flag 3: Passive Voice Hiding Actors

❌ "Quality results are delivered"
❌ "Costs are reduced"
❌ "Efficiency is improved"

Who does what? Be specific:

✓ "Our technicians complete residential HVAC installations in 6-8 hours"
✓ "Our system reduces your monthly utility costs by $120-180"

### Red Flag 4: Percentages Without Context

❌ "99% customer satisfaction"
❌ "50% cost reduction"
❌ "200% ROI"

Add context for credibility:

✓ "99% customer satisfaction (based on 840 post-service surveys conducted 30 days after installation)"
✓ "Average 50% cost reduction vs. previous manual process ($2,400 saved annually per client)"

### Red Flag 5: Comparisons Without Baselines

❌ "Better results"
❌ "Faster service"
❌ "More affordable"

Always state the comparison:

✓ "67% close rate vs. industry average of 27%"
✓ "2-hour response vs. 24-48 hour industry standard"
✓ "$2,400 vs. regional average of $3,200"

### Red Flag 6: Time Periods Without Benefits

❌ "25 years of experience"
❌ "Established in 1999"
❌ "Over two decades in business"

Convert to learned benefits:

✓ "Since 1999, we've diagnosed 2,000+ commercial refrigeration failures and learned that 80% occur due to three preventable causes—which is why our maintenance program focuses on these specific failure points"

### Red Flag 7: Generic Service Descriptions

❌ "We provide comprehensive pool maintenance"
❌ "Full-service HVAC solutions"
❌ "Complete plumbing services"

Be specific about what's included:

✓ "Weekly pool service includes chemical balancing, skimmer cleaning, filter backwashing, and equipment inspection—typically 45-minute visits on the same day each week"

---

## Writing Process Integration

Substance-first principles integrate with paragraph.md standards at every stage.

### Before Writing

Use this checklist before drafting:

- [ ] Who is the specific target audience? (not "homeowners" but "Collin County homeowners with aging pool heaters facing $2,000+ emergency repairs")
- [ ] What is their specific problem with measurable impacts? (not "pool heater issues" but "heater failure during spring swim season = 3-4 weeks without heating while waiting for parts")
- [ ] What is the measurable outcome you provide? (not "reliable service" but "extend heater lifespan from 8-10 years to 15+ years")
- [ ] What proof do you have? (case studies? client data? certifications?)
- [ ] How is this different from competitors? (specific features, not generic claims)

### During Writing

Apply both substance-first and paragraph.md simultaneously:

**Paragraph structure (from paragraphs.md):**
- 2-3 sentences per paragraph
- One idea per paragraph
- First sentence carries main point

**Substance requirements (from this guide):**
- Every sentence passes "So What?" test
- Every comparison includes baseline
- Every claim includes specifics (numbers, names, proof)

**Example combining both:**

✓ **Good (meets both standards):**
> Since 2018, we've maintained 847 pool heaters across Frisco, Plano, and McKinney—discovering that North Texas hard water (300-400 ppm calcium vs. 150 ppm national average) causes scale buildup 2.4x faster than manufacturer guidelines predict. This means bi-annual descaling instead of annual service, which extends your heater's lifespan from the typical 8-10 years to 15+ years.

**Why this works:**
- 2 sentences (paragraph.md)
- One clear idea (paragraph.md)
- First sentence has main point (paragraph.md)
- Specific numbers: 847 heaters, 300-400 ppm, 2.4x, 8-10 vs 15+ years (substance-first)
- Explains "so what" (extended lifespan) (substance-first)
- Shows learned expertise (substance-first)

### After Writing: The Audit

Run every paragraph through this audit:

**Substance audit:**
- [ ] Does every sentence answer "So what?"
- [ ] Do all comparisons include specific baselines?
- [ ] Are there specific numbers instead of vague quantities?
- [ ] Are real names used for testimonials? (or first name + city minimum)
- [ ] Would a competitor be unable to copy-paste this truthfully?
- [ ] Is expertise demonstrated through specific examples?
- [ ] Are all buzzwords eliminated or replaced?

**Structure audit (from paragraphs.md):**
- [ ] 2-3 sentences per paragraph
- [ ] One idea per paragraph
- [ ] Active voice in 80%+ of sentences
- [ ] First sentence independently understandable

## Common Transformation Examples

### Example 1: HVAC Services

❌ **Before (all fluff, no substance):**
> We are a premier HVAC company with years of experience providing quality heating and cooling solutions. Our world-class team is committed to excellence and customer satisfaction. We use cutting-edge technology to deliver superior results with best-in-class service.

✓ **After (passes all tests):**
> We've installed 1,240 residential HVAC systems across Collin County since 2015, completing most installations in 6-8 hours vs. the 2-3 day timeline common with larger companies. Our technicians are NATE-certified (North American Technician Excellence—only 40% of technicians nationally hold this credential) and use Manual J load calculations to right-size your system, preventing the 30-40% efficiency loss that comes from incorrectly sized units.

**What changed:**
- "Premier company with years of experience" → Specific: 1,240 installations since 2015
- "World-class team" → NATE certified (only 40% have this)
- "Quality solutions" → 6-8 hour completion vs. 2-3 day competitor timeline
- "Cutting-edge technology" → Manual J load calculations with specific benefit (prevent 30-40% efficiency loss)
- Added "so what" throughout (right-sizing prevents loss, faster completion means less disruption)

### Example 2: Pool Heater Maintenance

❌ **Before:**
> Our experienced team provides comprehensive pool heater maintenance services with a customer-focused approach. We use innovative techniques and quality parts to ensure your heater runs reliably all season long.

✓ **After:**
> Our maintenance program includes thermal imaging diagnostics that spot failing heat exchangers 4-6 months before they quit—preventing the $800-2,500 emergency repairs that happen when your heater fails in October (peak call season when parts are backordered 3-4 weeks). We've maintained 847 pool heaters since 2018, with 92% staying operational past their manufacturer warranty vs. the 34% industry average.

**What changed:**
- "Experienced team" → 847 heaters maintained since 2018, 92% vs. 34% success rate
- "Comprehensive maintenance" → Specific: thermal imaging catches failures 4-6 months early
- "Innovative techniques" → Named technology: thermal imaging
- "Runs reliably" → Specific problem avoided: $800-2,500 emergency repairs + 3-4 week backorder
- Added industry comparison with specific numbers

### Example 3: Epoxy Flooring

❌ **Before:**
> We are the leading epoxy flooring company providing high-quality garage floor coatings. Our expert installers have extensive experience and use premium materials. We deliver excellent results that last for years.

✓ **After:**
> We've completed 500+ epoxy garage floor installations in Windsor since 2015, using 100% solids epoxy that cures in 24 hours (vs. 72+ hours for standard epoxy coatings). This commercial-grade system handles vehicle traffic and chemical spills for 15-20 years—3x longer than garage floor paint (5-7 years typical lifespan).

**What changed:**
- "Leading company" → 500+ installations since 2015 in Windsor (specific, local, verifiable)
- "Expert installers with extensive experience" → Specific material: 100% solids epoxy with concrete benefit (24 vs 72 hour cure)
- "Premium materials" → Specific: commercial-grade with performance metric
- "Excellent results that last for years" → Specific: 15-20 years, comparison to alternative (3x longer than paint)

## Industry-Specific Patterns

### Home Services (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical)

**Replace:** "Emergency service available"
**With:** "2-hour guaranteed response in [CITY/COUNTY] with GPS tracking, or your service call is free"

**Replace:** "Experienced technicians"
**With:** "[CERTIFICATION] certified with average [X] years experience—only [Y]% of technicians in [STATE] hold this certification"

**Replace:** "Quality repairs"
**With:** "We complete [X]% of repairs on the first visit vs. the industry average of [Y]% (source: [if available]), and guarantee our work for [TIMEFRAME]"

### Pool Services

**Replace:** "Years of experience"
**With:** "Since [YEAR], we've maintained [NUMBER] pools in [AREA] and learned that [LOCAL CONDITION] requires [SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENT]"

**Replace:** "Comprehensive maintenance"
**With:** "[SPECIFIC SERVICES] performed [FREQUENCY], typically taking [TIME] per visit on [SCHEDULE]"

**Replace:** "Reliable service"
**With:** "[X]% of our clients stay with us [Y]+ years, with [Z]% reporting zero emergency calls during our service (based on [YEAR] client survey)"

### Flooring Services

**Replace:** "Durable flooring"
**With:** "[SPECIFIC MATERIAL] rated for [SPECIFIC USE] with [WARRANTY LENGTH] warranty, typically lasting [TIMEFRAME] vs. [ALTERNATIVE] which lasts [SHORTER TIMEFRAME]"

**Replace:** "Professional installation"
**With:** "We complete [SPACE SIZE] installations in [TIMEFRAME] using [SPECIFIC METHOD/EQUIPMENT], so you can use the space [SPECIFIC TIME] after completion"

---

## Integration With Other Guides

### With paragraphs.md

Substance-first principles work within paragraph structure:
- Each 2-3 sentence paragraph makes specific claims
- First sentence contains concrete information
- Supporting sentences add proof or comparison

### With faq.md

FAQ answers must be even more specific:
- Every answer includes numbers or names
- No generic "yes, we can do that" answers
- Each answer demonstrates expertise through specifics

### With tables.md

Tables organize specific data:
- Use tables to present comparisons clearly
- Include sources for third-party data
- Show specific numbers side-by-side

### With ymyl.md

YMYL content requires both caution AND specificity:
- Use "can help address" language (ymyl.md)
- But still include specific outcomes when appropriate
- Cite sources for all medical/financial claims
- Be specific about what you do, cautious about claims

**Example (YMYL + substance-first):**

✓ "Our hygienists typically complete cleanings in 45-60 minutes using ultrasonic scaling technology (reduces discomfort compared to manual scaling per ADA Journal 2023, Vol 154). Dr. Smith has completed over 2,000 cleanings since 2018 and can help address concerns about gum disease prevention."

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify every paragraph passes these tests:

**The Three Core Tests:**
- [ ] Every sentence answers "So what?" (why reader should care)
- [ ] Every comparison includes "As opposed to what?" (specific baseline)
- [ ] Every claim reaches Level 4+ on Specificity Ladder (includes numbers/names/proof)

**Mandatory Deletions:**
- [ ] All Tier 1 buzzwords eliminated (industry-leading, cutting-edge, etc.)
- [ ] All empty comparisons fixed (no "better" without stating than what)
- [ ] All obvious statements deleted (customer-focused, quality-driven)
- [ ] All weasel words replaced with specifics (no "many" without saying how many)

**Proof Standards:**
- [ ] Testimonials include names (company name or first name + city minimum)
- [ ] Statistics include sources when from third parties
- [ ] Claims include specific numbers (percentages, timelines, costs)
- [ ] Time periods converted to learned benefits

**Expertise Demonstration:**
- [ ] Specific business details included (number of projects, years, locations)
- [ ] Local knowledge shown (climate, regulations, common issues)
- [ ] Learned insights shared (patterns you've discovered)
- [ ] Unique processes or methods described specifically

**Red Flag Scan:**
- [ ] No three-adjectives-without-noun patterns
- [ ] No "we are" statements without proof
- [ ] No passive voice hiding actors
- [ ] No percentages without context
- [ ] No time periods without benefits
- [ ] No generic service descriptions

---

## Summary

Substance-first writing transforms generic content into authoritative, differentiated content through:

**Delete relentlessly:** Buzzwords, empty comparisons, obvious statements, and weasel words add no value
**Replace systematically:** Use proven patterns for time periods, features, comparisons, and claims
**Prove consistently:** Include specific numbers, names, sources, and verifiable data
**Climb the ladder:** Push every claim to Level 4+ specificity whenever possible

**The Golden Rule remains:** If a competitor could copy-paste your content and it would be equally true, you haven't written anything worth publishing.

Every sentence must answer "So what?" and "As opposed to what?" When combined with paragraph.md structure (2-3 sentences, one idea, first sentence carries weight), substance-first principles create content that:
- Establishes your authority through specific expertise
- Differentiates you from competitors through unique details
- Serves the reader by providing actionable, verifiable information
- Performs better in search through natural keyword use and comprehensiveness

Remember: Substance-first applies to all content types. These standards layer on top of structural guidelines (paragraphs, lists, tables, FAQs) and work alongside context-specific requirements (YMYL, industry standards).
