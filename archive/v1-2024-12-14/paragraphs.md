# Paragraph Writing Standards

Standards for paragraph and body content in SEO-driven web articles. These guidelines are optimized for scanning readers, mobile devices, and search engines.

**Key principle:** Web readers scan, they don't read linearly like essay readers. Every paragraph must be scannable, concise, and focused on a single idea.

## When to Use This Guide

**Use paragraphs.md for:**
- ✓ Body paragraphs throughout articles
- ✓ Introduction paragraphs (after the topic sentence)
- ✓ Transitional paragraphs between sections
- ✓ Explanatory and narrative content within sections

**Defer to other guides for:**
- ✗ FAQ answers → use `faq.md`
- ✗ Table content → use `tables.md`
- ✗ List items → use `lists.md`
- ✗ YMYL-specific requirements → use `ymyl.md` first, then this guide

---

## Topic Sentences - REQUIRED

Every article MUST begin with a topic sentence as the first sentence immediately after the H1 heading. The topic sentence directly answers the reader's search query and establishes the company's identity and primary benefit.

**Placement:** First sentence after H1 only. Topic sentences are not used elsewhere in the article.

### Non-YMYL Services Formula

```
[COMPANY NAME] is [YOUR CITY]'s [DESCRIPTOR] [SERVICE TYPE] that [SPECIFIC BENEFIT]
```

**Component breakdown:**
- **Company name** - Your business name
- **City** - Local SEO signal (e.g., "Windsor", "Toronto", "Houston")
- **Descriptor** - Authority signal (e.g., "premier", "trusted", "expert")
- **Service type** - What you do (e.g., "epoxy flooring specialist", "emergency plumber", "cooling specialist")
- **Specific benefit** - Concrete value proposition

**Examples:**
- "CONCRETE SURFACES is Windsor's premier epoxy flooring specialist that transforms garage floors with lasting protection and stunning aesthetics."
- "Bob's Plumbing is Toronto's trusted emergency plumber that responds within 60 minutes to prevent water damage."
- "Elite HVAC is Houston's expert cooling specialist that reduces energy bills through efficient system design."

### YMYL Topics Formula

```
[PROVIDER NAME] is a [SOLUTION TYPE] that can help address [GENERAL CONCERN]
```

**Component breakdown:**
- **Provider name** - Your business or practice name
- **Solution type** - What you provide (service, treatment, guidance)
- **General concern** - The problem area (not specific medical claims)

**Note:** YMYL content has additional requirements. See `ymyl.md` for complete YMYL-specific directives before writing YMYL content.

**Key differences from Non-YMYL:**
- Uses "can help" instead of definitive claims
- Focuses on "addressing" concerns rather than "solving" problems
- More cautious language throughout
- No location-based claims (avoid "best" or "premier" for medical/financial)

## Web Paragraph Structure

Web paragraphs are fundamentally different from essay paragraphs. They're designed for scanners, not linear readers.

### Target Length: 2-3 Sentences

**Why 2-3 sentences?**
- Web readers scan 20-28% of page content (Nielsen Norman Group)
- Shorter paragraphs create white space, improving scannability
- Mobile screens make long paragraphs look like walls of text
- Each paragraph = one scannable chunk of information
- Better readability scores and SEO metrics

**Paragraph length guidelines:**
- **Ideal:** 2-3 sentences
- **Maximum:** 4 sentences (rare cases with complex information)
- **Minimum:** 1 sentence (for emphasis or transition)

### One Idea Per Paragraph

Each paragraph should convey exactly one micro-idea. If you're covering multiple points, break them into separate paragraphs.

**Good (one idea per paragraph):**
> Epoxy floors last 15-20 years because they bond chemically with concrete rather than sitting on top like paint. You get a surface that handles vehicle traffic, chemical spills, and temperature changes without degrading.

> We've installed over 500 epoxy floors in Windsor garages since 2015. This experience means we can assess your concrete condition, recommend the right system, and complete installation in one weekend.

**Poor (multiple ideas crammed together):**
> Epoxy floors last 15-20 years and we've installed over 500 of them in Windsor since 2015, which means we have the experience to assess your concrete and recommend the right system for your garage, and we can usually complete the installation in just one weekend with minimal disruption to your schedule.

### Simple Sentence Structure

**Sentence 1: Main Point**
- State the key information clearly
- Scanners often read only the first sentence
- Front-load the most important information

**Sentence 2: Supporting Detail**
- Provide proof, example, or benefit
- Answer "why does this matter?"
- Connect to reader's needs

**Sentence 3 (Optional): Connection**
- Link to next idea or section
- Provide implication or outcome
- Transition smoothly

**Example:**
> **[Main point]** Epoxy flooring bonds at the molecular level with concrete, creating an integrated surface. **[Why it matters]** This chemical bond means your floor can withstand heavy vehicle traffic and chemical spills without the cracking or peeling you'd see with paint. **[Connection]** The result is a garage floor that looks professional for 15-20 years with minimal maintenance.

## Writing for Scanners

Web readers don't read word-by-word. They scan for information. Design your paragraphs for scanning behavior.

### How People Scan Web Content

**F-Pattern scanning:**
- Read the headline (H1, H2)
- Read the first sentence of paragraphs
- Scan down the left side looking for keywords
- Stop when they find relevant information

**What this means for writing:**
- First sentence must carry the weight of the paragraph
- Put key information early in the sentence
- Use keywords naturally in opening sentences
- Make each paragraph independently understandable

### White Space Is a Feature

Short paragraphs create white space, which:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Makes content appear less intimidating
- Helps readers locate information quickly
- Improves mobile reading experience
- Signals "this is easy to consume"

**Don't fear single-sentence paragraphs** for emphasis or transitions.

### Mobile-First Considerations

Most readers view content on mobile devices:
- A 3-sentence paragraph fills one mobile viewport
- Longer paragraphs require scrolling within the paragraph
- White space between paragraphs provides visual relief
- Shorter paragraphs feel less overwhelming on small screens

---

## Active Voice and Sentence Clarity

Web content demands directness. Use active voice and clear sentence structures.

### Subject-Object-Predicate Structure

**Format:** [Actor] [Action] [Object]

**Good (active voice, clear actor):**
- ✓ "We install epoxy coatings that bond with your concrete."
- ✓ "Our team completes most installations in one weekend."
- ✓ "This coating protects your floor from chemical spills."

**Poor (passive voice, unclear actor):**
- ✗ "Epoxy coatings are installed by our team."
- ✗ "Most installations are completed within one weekend."
- ✗ "Your floor is protected from chemical spills by this coating."

### Why Active Voice Matters

**Clarity:** Readers immediately know who does what
**Brevity:** Active voice uses fewer words
**Authority:** Positions your business as the actor
**SEO:** Search engines favor clear, direct content
**Engagement:** Creates stronger connection with readers

### When Passive Voice Is Acceptable

Use passive voice sparingly when:
- The actor is unknown or unimportant: "The concrete was damaged by freeze-thaw cycles."
- You want to emphasize the object: "Your investment is protected by our 10-year warranty."
- YMYL content requires caution: "Treatment options should be discussed with your dentist."

**Target:** 80-90% of sentences should use active voice.

---

## Economy of Language

Web readers are impatient. Every word must earn its place.

### Cut Unnecessary Words

**Wordy phrases to avoid:**
- ✗ "due to the fact that" → ✓ "because"
- ✗ "in order to" → ✓ "to"
- ✗ "at this point in time" → ✓ "now"
- ✗ "has the ability to" → ✓ "can"
- ✗ "it is important to note that" → ✓ [delete entirely]
- ✗ "the thing that is important is" → ✓ [state the important thing directly]

### Choose Concrete Over Abstract

**Abstract (weak):**
> Our company provides quality service with excellent results.

**Concrete (strong):**
> We complete garage floor installations in one weekend with a 10-year warranty.

**Concrete language includes:**
- Specific numbers (timeframes, quantities, percentages)
- Tangible outcomes (what readers can see, touch, measure)
- Real examples (actual projects, case studies)
- Precise verbs (transform, install, reduce vs. improve, help, provide)

### Incorporate Business Expertise

Use specific details from your business background to establish authority:

**Generic (anyone could write this):**
> We have a lot of experience with epoxy flooring and use quality materials.

**Specific (demonstrates expertise):**
> We've installed over 500 epoxy floors in Windsor garages since 2015, using commercial-grade polyaspartic topcoats that cure in 24 hours instead of the 72-hour cure time of standard epoxy.

**Details that establish expertise:**
- Years in business with specific start date
- Number of completed projects (locally)
- Certifications and training
- Proprietary processes or techniques
- Equipment or materials that competitors don't use
- Local knowledge (climate considerations, building codes)
- Response times or service guarantees

## Coherence and Flow

Coherent paragraphs flow smoothly and connect ideas clearly. For web content, coherence must work both within paragraphs and across the scanning experience.

### 1. Repeat Key Terms Consistently

Maintain consistent terminology for main concepts. This helps both readers and search engines.

**Consistent (good):**
> Epoxy flooring creates a durable surface. The epoxy bonds chemically with concrete. This epoxy system lasts 15-20 years.

**Inconsistent (confusing):**
> Epoxy flooring creates a durable surface. The coating bonds chemically with concrete. This floor treatment lasts 15-20 years.

**For SEO:** Keyword repetition strengthens topical relevance without keyword stuffing when done naturally.

### 2. Use Parallel Structures

Parallel structures make sentences clearer and easier to scan.

**Parallel (good):**
- "We inspect the foundation, prepare the surface, and apply the coating."
- "Our process saves time, reduces costs, and ensures quality."

**Non-parallel (harder to process):**
- "We inspect the foundation, surface preparation, and then apply the coating."
- "Our process saves time, cost reduction, and ensures quality."

### 3. Maintain Consistency

Keep these elements consistent throughout content:

**Point of view:**
- Choose second person ("you") for direct engagement
- Or third person ("homeowners," "clients") for professional distance
- Don't shift between them within a section

**Verb tense:**
- Present tense for current facts: "Epoxy lasts 15 years"
- Past tense for case studies: "We completed the installation"
- Future tense for outcomes: "You'll notice the difference"

**Number:**
- Don't shift from singular to plural: "a homeowner" → "they"
- Maintain subject-verb agreement

### 4. Use Strategic Transitions

Transitions help scanners understand relationships between ideas.

**Between sentences (within paragraphs):**
Use subtle transitions that maintain flow without adding unnecessary words:
- This, that, these, those (pointing back to previous sentence)
- However, but, yet (showing contrast)
- Therefore, thus, so (showing result)

**Between paragraphs (within the same section):**
Use transitions when shifting focus or introducing contrast:
- "Beyond durability, epoxy offers..." (shifting focus)
- "The installation process begins with..." (moving to next stage)
- "However, not all epoxy systems..." (introducing contrast)

Keep transitions minimal - often the content connection is clear without explicit transitions.

**Between sections (after H2 headings):**
First paragraph introduces what this section covers. Don't force transitions to previous sections - scanners jump directly to H2s that interest them, so each section must stand independently.

#### Common Transition Words

**To add information:** also, additionally, furthermore, moreover, in fact
**To show examples:** for example, for instance, specifically, such as
**To compare:** similarly, likewise, in the same way
**To contrast:** however, but, yet, although, despite, on the other hand
**To show result:** therefore, thus, so, as a result, consequently
**To show time:** first, next, then, finally, meanwhile, immediately
**To conclude:** ultimately, in summary, overall

**Use sparingly:** Transitions should enhance clarity, not clutter sentences. Many transitions can be implied through context rather than stated explicitly.

---

## Section-Level Structure

Sections are marked by H2 headings and serve as independent, scannable units. Readers jump directly to sections that interest them, so each section must make sense on its own.

### Section Components

**Section opening (first paragraph after H2):**
- Introduces what this section covers
- Explains the main point or benefit
- Sets expectations for the section content
- **No transition from previous section needed** - scanners may land here directly

**Section body (middle paragraphs):**
- Each paragraph = one supporting point (2-3 sentences)
- May include tables, lists, or other elements
- Build logically within the section

**Section close (final paragraph before next H2):**
- Summarizes section's key takeaway
- May include call-to-action if appropriate
- **No transition to next section needed** - next H2 is self-explanatory

### Section Independence

Design each section to stand alone:
- H2 heading clearly identifies the topic
- First paragraph explains what's being discussed
- Content is complete within the section
- No dependency on reading previous sections

**Why:** Scanners use H2s to navigate. They skip sections that don't interest them and jump directly to relevant ones. Linear reading flow between sections is unnecessary and assumes behavior that doesn't match how people actually use web content.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing content, verify each paragraph meets these standards:

**Structure:**
- [ ] 2-3 sentences (occasionally 4 for complex ideas, or 1 for emphasis)
- [ ] One clear idea per paragraph
- [ ] First sentence carries the main point
- [ ] Creates white space between paragraphs

**Clarity:**
- [ ] Uses active voice (subject-object-predicate)
- [ ] Eliminates unnecessary words
- [ ] Uses concrete, specific language
- [ ] Avoids jargon or defines it clearly

**Coherence:**
- [ ] Maintains consistent point of view
- [ ] Maintains consistent verb tense
- [ ] Repeats key terms appropriately
- [ ] Uses transitions where needed (but not excessively)

**Business positioning:**
- [ ] Incorporates specific business details where relevant
- [ ] Demonstrates expertise through concrete examples
- [ ] Positions company as authority

**Scanning optimization:**
- [ ] First sentence is independently understandable
- [ ] Key information appears early in sentences
- [ ] Looks scannable on mobile viewport
- [ ] White space aids visual processing

**For the opening paragraph specifically:**
- [ ] Topic sentence is the first sentence after H1
- [ ] Topic sentence uses the appropriate formula (Non-YMYL or YMYL)
- [ ] Company name, location (if applicable), and benefit are clearly stated
- [ ] Directly answers the reader's search query

---

## Summary

Web content demands a different approach than essay writing. Paragraphs must be:

**Short:** 2-3 sentences optimized for scanning and mobile reading
**Focused:** One micro-idea per paragraph
**Clear:** Active voice, subject-object-predicate structure
**Concrete:** Specific details and business expertise, not abstract claims
**Scannable:** First sentence carries the weight, white space aids discovery

The mandatory topic sentence after H1 establishes your company's position and directly answers the search query. Every subsequent paragraph should follow web-optimized structure to serve scanners who are looking for specific information quickly.

Remember: These standards apply to prose content. Element-specific guides (FAQ, tables, lists) take precedence for those content types. Context-specific guides (YMYL, industry standards) layer additional requirements on top of these baseline principles.
