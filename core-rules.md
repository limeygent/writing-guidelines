# Core Writing Rules (Tier 1)

**Load:** ALWAYS - every content generation task
**Purpose:** Non-negotiable rules that prevent bloated, unfocused content

---

## 1. PRIME DIRECTIVE

Answer the search query. ONLY the search query. Nothing else exists.

Every word must serve the reader's goal. If content doesn't help them solve their problem or make their decision, delete it.

---

## 2. PRIORITY CASCADE

Follow this hierarchy. Stop when the reader has what they need.

1. **Answer the query's CORE question** (mandatory)
2. **Enable immediate action** - DIY fix or call pro (mandatory)
3. **Prevent safety hazards** - gas leaks, electrical, CO (if applicable)
4. **[STOP HERE for most content]**
5. Add local context ONLY if it changes the answer
6. Add depth ONLY if intent is research-focused

If you're writing content for priority 5-6, ask: "Does this change what the reader should DO?" If no, cut it.

---

## 3. INSTANT DISQUALIFICATION PATTERNS

Your content will be REJECTED if it contains any of these:

### Same Information Twice
- Table + prose explaining table contents = **REJECT**
- Concept in overview AND repeated in later section = **REJECT**
- Same troubleshooting step in multiple symptom discussions = **REJECT**

**Correct approach:** Cross-reference with one sentence: "As covered in [section]..."

### Completeness Rules (Intent-Dependent)

**Troubleshooting intent** ("won't work", "blowing cold"):
- 4-5 causes max = ✓ CORRECT
- Cover common scenarios only
- Link to detailed resource for rare cases
- Edge cases equal to common issues = **REJECT**

**Identification intent** ("making noise", "what's wrong", "types of"):
- Reader needs to FIND their specific issue among options
- 6-10 items is acceptable when each is distinct
- Use reference table for quick scanning
- Shorter depth per item (50-80 words each)
- Artificially limiting to 4-5 when more exist = **REJECT**

**Decision intent** ("repair vs replace", "which is better"):
- Cover all relevant factors for the decision
- Don't artificially limit comparison points
- Table format mandatory

**The test:** Ask "Could the reader's actual issue be something I didn't cover?"
- If yes (troubleshooting): Acceptable - cover common cases, link for rare
- If yes (identification): NOT acceptable - they need to find their issue

### Stock Phrase Spam
- "Contact a professional" appearing more than 2x = **REJECT**
- "Safety first" or "important to note" more than 1x = **REJECT**
- Any phrase appearing 3+ times unchanged = **REJECT**

**Correct approach:** Vary language, convert to links, or consolidate to single "When to Call" section.

### Scope Expansion
- Financing options in troubleshooting article = **REJECT**
- Service call expectations (100+ words) in symptom article = **REJECT**
- Regional content unless it changes the answer = **REJECT**
- Preventive maintenance in repair-focused article = **REJECT**

**Correct approach:** Stay ruthlessly on-topic. Link to separate pages for tangential content.

### Search-Engine-First Warning Signs
Content will be FLAGGED if it shows these patterns:

- Written to hit a word count rather than answer the query
- Covers topics you have no real expertise in just to capture traffic
- Summarizes what others say without adding unique value
- Promises answers to questions that have no real answer
- Leaves readers needing to search again for better information

**The test:** Would this content exist if search engines didn't? If no, reconsider.

---

## 4. WORD COUNT CHECKPOINTS

### At 500 Words - Self-Check
- [ ] Have I directly answered the search query's main question?
- [ ] Is every paragraph ESSENTIAL to that answer?
- [ ] Have I repeated any concept yet? (If yes, consolidate now)

### At 1,000 Words - Review Gate
- [ ] Grep for key phrases - each appears in 1 location only?
- [ ] Does every H2 section answer the original query?
- [ ] Could I delete any section without losing essential info? (If yes, DELETE IT)

### At 1,500 Words - MANDATORY STOP

**Do not write another word until you complete these steps:**

1. Open your first 500 words
2. Open your last 500 words
3. Find duplicate concepts (there ARE some)
4. Consolidate or delete before continuing

### At 2,000+ Words - CONTENT FAILED

Your article is too long because:
- You explained something twice
- You included tangential information
- You listed exhaustive causes instead of common ones

**Required action:** Find duplicates and merge. Do NOT truncate the ending - fix the source of bloat.

---

## 5. INTENT TEMPLATES & WORD BUDGETS

### Troubleshooting Intent
**Query patterns:** "won't work", "not working", "blowing cold", "won't turn on"

**Structure:**
1. Problem acknowledgment + quick answer
2. Causes (4-5 max)
3. DIY fixes
4. When to call for service

**Word Budget:**
| Section | Words |
|---------|-------|
| Intro (answer query) | 100-150 |
| Each cause | 80-120 (max 5 = 400-600) |
| DIY section | 150-200 |
| When to call | 100-150 |
| **Total** | **750-1,100** |

**Professional mentions:** Max 2

---

### Comparison Intent
**Query patterns:** "vs", "or", "compared to", "difference between"

**Structure:**
1. Quick answer (recommendation)
2. Comparison table
3. Context for decision
4. Final recommendation

**Word Budget:**
| Section | Words |
|---------|-------|
| Quick answer | 100-150 |
| Table intro | 50-75 |
| Table | 150-200 |
| Context | 200-300 |
| Recommendation | 100-150 |
| **Total** | **600-875** |

**Professional mentions:** Max 1 (in consultation CTA)

---

### Maintenance Intent
**Query patterns:** "how often", "should I", "when to", "how to maintain"

**Structure:**
1. Quick answer (frequency/yes-no)
2. Steps or checklist
3. Consequences of skipping
4. Professional vs DIY guidance

**Word Budget:**
| Section | Words |
|---------|-------|
| Quick answer | 80-100 |
| Steps/checklist | 300-400 |
| Consequences | 100-150 |
| Pro vs DIY | 100-150 |
| **Total** | **580-800** |

**Professional mentions:** Max 2

---

### Educational Intent
**Query patterns:** "how does", "what is", "why does", "explain"

**Structure:**
1. Simple answer (ELI5)
2. How it works
3. Why it matters to homeowner
4. When to care about this

**Word Budget:**
| Section | Words |
|---------|-------|
| Simple answer | 100-150 |
| How it works | 200-300 |
| Why it matters | 150-200 |
| When to care | 100-150 |
| **Total** | **550-800** |

**Professional mentions:** Max 1

---

### Identification Intent
**Query patterns:** "making noise", "what's wrong with", "types of", "why is my [doing X]"

**Key difference:** Reader doesn't know their specific problem yet. They need to FIND it among options.

**Structure:**
1. Quick triage statement
2. Reference table (ALL common types with urgency column)
3. DIY checks (if applicable)
4. Professional causes (brief depth, 50-80 words each)
5. Normal behaviors (brief list)
6. Emergency indicators
7. Service expectations + authority signals
8. CTA

**Word Budget:**
| Section | Words |
|---------|-------|
| Intro | 75-100 |
| Reference table | 150-250 (6-10 rows) |
| DIY section | 100-150 |
| Each professional cause | 50-80 (×4-6 = 200-480) |
| Normal behaviors | 50-75 |
| Emergency indicators | 75-100 |
| Service + authority | 100-150 |
| CTA | 50-75 |
| **Total** | **800-1,350** |

**Required elements:**
- Urgency column in reference table
- At least 2 authority signals (see Section 6.5)
- Cost ranges for each professional cause

**Professional mentions:** Max 3

---

## 6. SHORTCODES

Use these shortcodes instead of hardcoding business information:

| Shortcode | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `[business_name]` | Company name |
| `[business_phone_link]` | Phone number with click-to-call |

**Example:**
```html
<p>This guide from [business_name] covers DIY fixes and when to call for service.</p>
<p>Call [business_phone_link] for same-day service.</p>
```

**Never hardcode:**
- Company names
- Phone numbers
- Addresses (if applicable)

---

## 6.5 AUTHORITY SIGNALS (Required)

Every article MUST include at least 2 of these credibility markers:

| Signal Type | Example | Where to Place |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Credentials | "EPA-certified technicians" | CTA section |
| Experience | "20+ years serving Dallas" | Opening or CTA |
| Licensing | "Licensed (TACLA00152199C)" | CTA or footer |
| Trust markers | "A+ BBB rating" | CTA section |
| Regional expertise | Specific local insight (see below) | Within relevant cause |

### Authority Signals vs. Promotional Fluff

**Good (demonstrates expertise):**
> Furnaces in North Texas often sit idle 8-9 months. Dust accumulates on burners during this time, making delayed ignition common when you first fire up the system in November.

**Bad (generic promotion):**
> We're the best HVAC company in the area with great customer service and competitive prices.

### When Regional Expertise Adds Value

Include regional content when it:
- Explains WHY a problem is common locally (humidity, dust, temperature swings)
- Changes WHAT the reader should do
- Demonstrates you understand LOCAL conditions

**Keep to:** 1-2 sentences integrated into a relevant cause section. NOT a standalone regional section.

---

## 6.6 EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATION (Company Voice)

Show expertise through company voice without fabricating personal claims.

### Principles
- Use **company voice** ("Our team has found...") not personal voice ("I've seen...")
- Use **qualified language** ("Technicians commonly report...") for industry knowledge
- Keep brief: 1-2 sentences maximum per article
- Place naturally within cause explanations or CTA sections

### Approved Patterns

**Company voice:**
- "In [X] years serving North Texas, our technicians have found that..."
- "Across thousands of service calls, we've seen this pattern..."
- "Our team commonly encounters this during [season/condition]..."

**Qualified language:**
- "HVAC professionals typically report that..."
- "Industry experience shows..."
- "This is among the most common [issue type] in [region]..."

### Anti-Patterns (Never Use)

| ❌ Don't Write | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| "In my 20 years..." | Personal claim by LLM |
| "I've personally diagnosed..." | Fabricated experience |
| "I remember one customer..." | Invented anecdote |

### YMYL Restriction

**For YMYL content** (health, medical, finance, legal, safety):
- Do NOT use experience demonstrations or anecdotes
- Stick to factual statements only
- Defer to credentials (licenses, certifications) instead of experience narratives

Experience claims in YMYL topics can wander into legal/medical ethics territory. Keep it factual.

### Placement
- Within a cause explanation (1 sentence showing pattern recognition)
- In CTA section (tying company experience to service quality)
- NOT in opening paragraphs (keep those factual/direct)

---

## 7. HARD CONSTRAINTS

### Required Elements (every article)

| Element | Requirement | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Authority signals | 2 of 5 types minimum | See Section 6.5 |
| Cost guidance | 3+ ranges | For troubleshooting/repair content |
| Emergency indicators | Required section | For safety-related topics |
| Shortcodes | All business info | Never hardcode names/phones |

### Content Limits (Intent-Dependent)

| Element | Troubleshooting | Identification | Comparison | Educational |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Causes/types | 4-5 max | 6-10 allowed | N/A | N/A |
| Table rows | 5-6 | 6-10 | 4-6 | 3-5 |
| Cost ranges | 4-6 | 6-10 | 2-4 | 0-2 |
| Regional sentences | 1-2 | 1-2 | 0-1 | 0-1 |
| Word budget | 750-1,100 | 800-1,350 | 600-875 | 550-800 |

### Universal Limits (all intents)
| Element | Maximum | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Professional mentions | 3 total | More = sales pitch |
| H2 section length | 300 words | Forces concision |
| List items | 6 per list | Split longer lists |
| Paragraphs | 4 sentences max | Aids scanning |

### Banned Patterns
**Never use:**
- Em-dashes (—) - use commas, parentheses, or new sentences
- "You're not alone" / "Don't worry" - empathy fluff
- "It's important to note" / "As you may know" - filler
- "In addition to" / "Another thing to consider" - scope creep signals
- Vague claims any competitor could copy-paste

### Required Voice
- **Contractions:** Required (you're, isn't, won't, can't)
- **Voice:** Active 80%+ of sentences
- **Address:** Direct "you" and "your"
- **Numbers:** Numerals always (3-4 years, not "three to four")
- **Lists:** Oxford commas required
- **Tone:** Helpful expert, not salesy or clinical

---

## 8. PRE-FLIGHT QUESTIONS

**Answer these BEFORE writing:**

1. **What is the exact search query?**
   Write it down. Every section must serve this query.

2. **What action does this enable for the reader?**
   - Fix something themselves?
   - Decide to call a pro?
   - Choose between options?
   - Understand if something is normal?

3. **What type of intent is this?** (determines structure + limits)
   - **Troubleshooting:** They know the problem, need causes/fixes → 4-5 causes, 750-1,100 words
   - **Identification:** They need to find their specific issue → 6-10 options, table-first, 800-1,350 words
   - **Decision:** They're choosing between options → comparison table, 600-875 words
   - **Educational:** They want to understand how/why → concept-focused, 550-800 words

4. **What's the MINIMUM information needed for that action?**
   List only what's essential. This is your outline.

5. **What authority signals can I include?**
   - License number?
   - Years of experience?
   - Certifications (EPA, manufacturer)?
   - Trust markers (BBB rating)?
   - Regional expertise insight?

   **Must include at least 2.**

6. **What would I cut if forced to halve the word count?**
   Whatever you listed - question whether it belongs at all.

---

## 9. PRE-PUBLISH CHECKS

### Automated Grep Checks
Run these before submitting:

```bash
# Concept repetition (each should appear ≤2 times)
grep -in "filter" content.md | wc -l
grep -in "thermostat" content.md | wc -l
grep -in "vent" content.md | wc -l

# Professional mentions (should be ≤3)
grep -ic "professional\|technician\|hvac tech" content.md

# Banned phrases (should be 0)
grep -ic "important to note\|worth noting\|keep in mind" content.md

# Em-dashes (should be 0)
grep -c "—" content.md
```

### Manual Checks
- [ ] Does the opening directly answer the search query?
- [ ] Is every concept explained exactly once?
- [ ] Do tables contain details while prose only introduces them?
- [ ] Is total word count under budget for this intent type?
- [ ] Would cutting any section lose ESSENTIAL information?
- [ ] Are there more than 5 items in any cause/reason list?

---

## 10. CONTENT TIGHTENING PROTOCOL

**Run this if you hit 1,500+ words:**

### Pass 1: Concept Deduplication
1. List the 3-5 core concepts in your article
2. Search for each concept term across ALL sections
3. Keep the best explanation, delete others
4. Add one-sentence cross-references where needed

### Pass 2: Table/Prose Audit
1. Find every table in the article
2. Read the prose immediately after each table
3. Delete any sentence that restates table data
4. Maximum 2 sentences of prose after any table

### Pass 3: List Pruning
1. Find all lists with more than 5 items
2. Identify which items cover 80% of real-world cases
3. Keep those 4-5 items, delete the rest
4. For deleted rare cases: "For less common issues, contact a technician"

### Pass 4: Stock Phrase Reduction
1. Search for "professional", "technician", "contact", "call"
2. Keep the first instance
3. Convert others to: link, assumed knowledge, or delete
4. Consolidate remaining into single "When to Call" section

### Pass 5: Scope Verification
1. Re-read the original search query
2. For each H2 section, ask: "Is this REQUIRED to answer the query?"
3. Sections about financing, regional info, service expectations = cut or link
4. Sections about rare causes, prevention in repair articles = cut or link

### Pass 6: Section Surgery (if still over budget)
1. You've done passes 1-5 and still over budget
2. The problem is structural, not sentence-level
3. Ask: "If I could only keep 3 sections, which would they be?"
4. Write THAT article instead

---

## 11. FORMAT DEFAULTS

### When to Use Tables (Tier 2 auto-loads)
- Comparisons between 2+ options
- Specifications with multiple attributes
- Feature matrices
- Any data with 2+ dimensions

**Tables are DEFAULT for comparisons. Prose is FALLBACK.**

### When to Use Lists (Tier 2 auto-loads)
- Procedures/steps (numbered)
- Collections of items (bulleted)
- Requirements/criteria (bulleted)
- Anything sequential or enumerable

**Lists are DEFAULT for procedures. Prose is FALLBACK.**

### When to Use Paragraphs
- Explanations requiring nuance
- Connecting ideas with transitions
- Narrative flow
- When tables/lists would feel forced

**Paragraphs are FALLBACK when tables/lists don't fit.**

### Paragraph Rules
- 2-3 sentences ideal
- 4 sentences maximum (complex ideas only)
- 1 sentence okay for emphasis or transitions
- One idea per paragraph
- Topic sentence after every H2

---

## 12. EXAMPLES (Inline)

### Good Troubleshooting Opening (Answers Query Immediately)
**Query:** "furnace blowing cold air"

> If your furnace is blowing cold air, check three things first: thermostat settings, air filter, and pilot light (gas furnaces). These cover 80% of cold air issues and take less than 5 minutes to inspect.

**Why it works:** Answers query in first sentence, gives actionable next steps, sets expectation.

---

### Good Identification Opening (Table-First for Scanning)
**Query:** "furnace making strange noises"

> Different furnace noises indicate different problems. This guide from [business_name] helps you identify what you're hearing and whether it needs immediate attention.
>
> | Noise | Likely Cause | Urgency |
> |-------|--------------|---------|
> | Loud bang | Delayed ignition | Turn off, call now |
> | Grinding | Motor bearings failing | Call within 24 hrs |
> | Squealing | Belt or bearing issue | Call within 1-2 days |
> | Rattling | Loose panel or duct | Check panels (DIY) |
> | Clicking (repeated) | Ignition attempts failing | Call for service |
> | Humming (loud) | Transformer or capacitor | Call within 1-2 days |
>
> Identify your noise in the sections below for specific causes, costs, and what to do.

**Why it works:**
- Triage table FIRST (reader finds their issue in seconds)
- Urgency column answers "is this serious?" immediately
- Covers 6 common noises (not artificially limited to 4)
- Each row is a distinct, identifiable option
- Intro + table = ~175 words, then brief depth per cause

---

### Bad Opening (Buries the Answer)
**Query:** "furnace blowing cold air"

> There's nothing worse than expecting warm air from your furnace and feeling cold air instead. This frustrating problem affects thousands of homeowners every winter, especially here in North Texas where temperature swings can be extreme. Understanding how your furnace works can help you diagnose the issue...

**Why it fails:** 50+ words before any useful information. Empathy fluff. Regional content. Buries the answer.

---

### Good Cause Section (Concise)
> **Dirty Air Filter**
>
> A clogged filter restricts airflow, causing your furnace to overheat and trigger the safety limit switch. This shuts off the burners while the blower continues running, producing cold air.
>
> **Fix:** Check your filter. If you can't see light through it, replace it. Run your furnace for 15 minutes after replacing to see if the problem resolves.

**Word count:** 67 words. Complete explanation + actionable fix.

---

### Bloated Cause Section (Too Long)
> **Dirty Air Filter**
>
> One of the most common reasons your furnace might be blowing cold air is a dirty or clogged air filter. Your furnace's air filter is responsible for trapping dust, dirt, pet dander, and other airborne particles before they can enter your HVAC system. Over time, these particles accumulate on the filter, reducing airflow through the system.
>
> When airflow is restricted, your furnace has to work harder to push air through the system. This extra strain can cause the heat exchanger to overheat. To protect itself from damage, your furnace has a safety feature called a limit switch that monitors the temperature of the heat exchanger. When temperatures get too high, the limit switch trips and shuts off the burners.
>
> However, even though the burners shut off, the blower fan continues to run. This is actually a safety feature designed to cool down the heat exchanger. But from your perspective, it means your furnace is now blowing unheated air through your vents, which feels cold compared to what you were expecting.
>
> The good news is that this is one of the easiest furnace problems to fix yourself...

**Word count:** 200+ words. Same information, 3x longer. Repeats concepts. Unnecessary detail about how filters work.

---

### Good Table Usage (No Prose Duplication)
> **Heat Pump vs. Furnace: Quick Comparison**
>
> | Factor | Heat Pump | Gas Furnace |
> |--------|-----------|-------------|
> | Best climate | Mild (above 35°F) | Cold (below 35°F) |
> | Energy source | Electricity | Natural gas |
> | Upfront cost | $4,000-7,000 | $3,000-5,000 |
> | Operating cost | Lower in mild climates | Lower in cold climates |
>
> For North Texas, heat pumps handle 90% of winter days efficiently, with backup heat for rare deep freezes.

**Why it works:** Table contains the data. Prose adds context not in the table.

---

### Bad Table Usage (Duplicates Prose)
> Heat pumps work best in mild climates where temperatures stay above 35°F, while gas furnaces are better for cold climates below 35°F. Heat pumps use electricity and cost between $4,000-7,000 upfront, whereas gas furnaces use natural gas and cost $3,000-5,000. Operating costs are lower for heat pumps in mild climates but lower for furnaces in cold climates.
>
> | Factor | Heat Pump | Gas Furnace |
> |--------|-----------|-------------|
> | Best climate | Mild (above 35°F) | Cold (below 35°F) |
> | Energy source | Electricity | Natural gas |
> | Upfront cost | $4,000-7,000 | $3,000-5,000 |
> | Operating cost | Lower in mild climates | Lower in cold climates |

**Why it fails:** Prose restates every cell in the table. Reader sees same info twice.
